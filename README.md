## PROBLEM STATEMENT

## KPI‘s  Requirement: 

The HR department is responsible for monitotring and managing various aspects of employee data to  ensure the organisation maintains a healthy workforce. However there is a lack of clear performance indicator to track and analyse HR metrics.Therefore there is a need and design to implement a set of KPI‘s (Key Performance Indicator) to address the following points.

1. Employee Count:
HR department lacks of visibility in total number of employees, making it challanging to workforce size         and plan for the future growth or downsizing effectively.

2. Attrition Count:
The organisation lacks a standerdised method to track employee attrition resulting in incomplete and unreliable data on the number of employees who have left the organisation.

3. Attrition Rate:
With a clear measure of attrition rate, the organisation cannot access thr overall turnover level or compare it with industry benchmarkds, hindering the ability to gauge employee satisfaction and engagement.

4. Active Employees:
The organisation lacks a mechanism to differentiate between active and inactive employees, leading to difficulties in accurately accessing the current workforce‘s productivity and capacity.

5. Average Age:
The HR department lacks visibility into the average age of employees making it difficult to evaluate workforce demographics, succession planning and the organisation ability to attract and retrain young talents.

## Chart‘s requirement

1. Attrition by Gender:
HR department faces challanges in understanding the attrition patterns based on gender making it difficult to identify any gender-related disparities and implement targeted retension strategies.

2. Department wise Attritions:
The HR department lacks visualisations to showcase attrition rates across different departments.This hinders theit ability to identify departments with higher attrition rates and address any underlying issues or concerns effectively.

3. Number of employees by age group:
The HR department requires visual representation to analyse the distribution of employees across various age groups. This helps in accessing workforce demographichs, identifying any age related gaps or imbalances and implemented targeted HR Policies or programs.

4. Job Satisfaction ratings:
The HR department lacks visualisations to represent job satisfaction ratings, híndering theit abilities to measure employee engagement and overall job satisfaction levels effectively.

5. Education field wise Attrition:
The HR department requires visual representation to analyse attrition rates based on education fields. This helps to identify specific educational backgrounds that may be associated with higher attritions, enabling the organisation to tailor retention stratergies accordingly.

6. Attrition Rate by Gender for different age groups:
The HR department lacks visualisations that displays attrition rates based on gender and different age groups. This makes it challanging to identify any age and gender related attrition trends, preventing the organisation from implementing targeted retension stratergies for specific employee segments.
