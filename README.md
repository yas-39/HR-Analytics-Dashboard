PROBLEM STATEMENT

KPI‘s  Requirement: 

The HR department is responsible for monitotring and managing various aspects of employee data to  ensure the organisation maintains a healthy workforce. However there is a lack of clear performance indicator to track and analyse HR metrics.Therefore there is a need and design to implement a set of KPI‘s (Key Performance Indicator) to address the following points.

1. Employee Count:
HR department lacks of visibility in total number of employees, making it challanging to workforce size         and plan for the future growth or downsizing effectively.

2. Attrition Count:
The organisation lacks a standerdised method to track employee attrition resulting in incomplete and unreliable data on the number of employees who have left the organisation.

3. Attrition Rate:
With a clear measure of attrition rate, the organisation cannot access thr overall turnover level or compare it with industry benchmarkds, hindering the ability to gauge employee satisfaction and engagement.

4. Active Employees:
The organisation lacks a mechanism to differentiate between active and inactive employees, leading to difficulties in accurately accessing the current workforce‘s productivity and capacity.

5. Average Age:
The HR department lacks visibility into the average age of employees making it difficult to evaluate workforce demographics, succession planning and the organisation ability to attract and retrain young talents.
